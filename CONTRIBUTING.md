# How to Contribute to libMyPaint

libMyPaint is a volunteer-run project, built and maintained by many
contributors. It is part of the wider MyPaint project. We welcome new
team members, and value feedback from anyone using this library, whether
they're artists using MyPaint and wanting new brush ending features, or
third party app developers building cool stuff with libmypaint. Most of
our documentation for new contributors can be found on the wiki:

* [How to report issues][1] - **please read** if you came here from the issue tracker.
* [Get Involved][2] - how you can help MyPaint improve and grow.

Note that MyPaint is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct][3].
